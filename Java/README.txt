This file discusses and explains the given JAVA programs. Each of these were major
projects completed for various courses. 

Note: Netbeans IDE was used to create each of these files

chatRoom.zip
	- Purpose: The assignment was to create a chatRoom where people could connect to a
	  MultiCast IP and a particular socket to talk with one another. These files also
	  implement a GUI to handle the chatting. This was created in Networking

HOS.zip
	- Purpose: The purpose of this assignment was to create a Hypothetical Operating System
	  in Java. There were three cases that needed to be fulfilled. This was created in 
	  Fundamentals of Computer Operating Systems

	- Case 1: First-In-First-Out Strategy with First Fit
		- This means that the hypothetical process would be placed in the first memory
		  block whose size could hold the process

	- Case 2: First-In-First-Out Strategy with Best Fit
		- The process would be placed in the memory block that wasted the least space

	- Case 3: Shortest Job First Strategy with Best Fit
		- Took the shortest process and fit it in the block that wasted the least space

imageLabeling.zip
	- Purpose: The assignment was take an array of numbers labeled either 0 or 1 and re-label
	  them based on if the 1's were next to one another. This was created in Data Structures
	  and Algorithms
	  (Ex. The array 1 0 1, would become 2 0 3)
			 1 0 1		     2 0 3
